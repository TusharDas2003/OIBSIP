                    <p>"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma -
                        which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions
                        drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and
                        intuition. They somehow know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."</p>
